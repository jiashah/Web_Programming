    <h1>Earth</h1>
    <p>Earth is the third planet from the sun, and the only place we know of so far thatâ€™s inhabited by living things.</p>
    <p>It is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface.</p>
    <p>Slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.</p>
